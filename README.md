# subShifter
I wrote this program quickly because I wanted to watch Anatomy of a Fall (great film, by the way!) 
but the subtitles I found weren't synchronized with the movie.
Hope you find this script useful. "Buona visione!"Ã¹

## usage
"""bash
python subShifter.py "filename" "time(ms)"
"""

## example
"""bash
python subShifter.py The.Holdovers.2023.srt 9000
"""
shift all the subtitles by 9 seconds
